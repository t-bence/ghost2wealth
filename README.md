Ghostfolio to Wealthfolio data conversion

This is a Python file that converts your Ghostfolio data to CSV(s) that can be imported into Wealthfolio.

You can use it the following way:

`python ghost2wealth.py data/ghostfolio-export.json`

Then the program will generate one CSV file for each account you have in Ghostfolio in the `data` folder. Make sure you create the folder first! These files can then be imported into Wealthfolio.
